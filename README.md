# Starter Pack CLI prototype

A demo for a prototype of Canonical's Starter Pack interface, re-envisioned with modern
CLI design.

Depends on [just](https://just.systems).

The anatomy of the commands is described in `commands.yaml`.

## Basic usage

Install from the script, then follow along in the terminal.

## Install

```bash
./proto.sh
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./proto.sh -r
```
