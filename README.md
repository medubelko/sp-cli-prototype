# Starter Pack CLI prototype

A demo for a prototype of Canonical's Starter Pack interface, re-envisioned with modern
CLI design.

Depends on [just](https://just.systems).

## Basic usage

Run the main script:

```bash
./proto.sh
```

Then, follow along in the terminal.

## Cleanup

After testing, if you'd like to remove just, run:

```bash
./proto.sh -r
```
